QabsFEP was written to calculate solvation free energies using a novel water replacement methodology.

Initial results show comparable performance to QligFEP and are deposited in the excel file absolute_solvationfree_energies.

The perturbation scheme is visualized in QabsFEP_cycle.jpeg, and details of each leg in QabsFEP_perturbation_legs.jpg.
