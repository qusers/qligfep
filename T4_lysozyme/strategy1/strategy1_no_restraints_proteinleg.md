First strategy that we tested was to not restrain the ligand inside the protein and compare these results with QabsFEP.

However, the ligand will move to unphysical places near the annihilation endpoint. Results are not optimal and vary.

Aditionally, restraints were also removed during the first FEP. However, these results were not promising and not incorporated here.
